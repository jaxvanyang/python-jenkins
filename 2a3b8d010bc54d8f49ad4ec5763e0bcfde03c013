      "message": "I didn\u0027t think about this earlier but it seems odd that users would need to use the jobs APIs to add/remove/modify folders.  At a conceptual level I would think most users associate folders to views.  I think it would be nice to have a create_folder()/delete_folder()/modify_folder() methods so the API is more intuitive and consistent with the views APIs.  Also that would allow users to create/update folders independently of jobs.  With that said i also feel that my suggestion can be done in a follow on change.",
