      "message": "Well, for this case, if we were to try to rename a job and get a 404, we\u0027d know that the job doesn\u0027t, in fact, exist, which is what assert_job_exists() is trying to check.  That makes assert_job_exists() redundant.  You might still want it after the actions, to ensure that they\u0027ve done what they\u0027re supposed to, but it would reduce the number of round-trips you have to make to the API, which should speed things up quite a bit.\n\nTo put this in perspective, when we run jenkins-jobs on our Jenkins configuration, it can take 30 minutes or more to update 96 jobs; any small reduction in time taken, such as could come from reducing the number of round trips, would be a huge win for us.",

Then only updating that list as necessary.\n\nShould reduce the number of round trips needed.\n\n@Kevin if you\u0027re finding performance with JJB an issue, I would suggest testing out the following approaches to parallel upload in JJB:\n\nIee8426ff2dc4c5b4ebec4c15bdd21cae5b47eb83\n\nIe92be45d418b8076874b9eabca7e4ea8fb8fbad1",
