      "message": "I didn\u0027t see a unit test specifically for _get_job_folder(); I suppose it\u0027s adequately tested by the other tests, but that\u0027s sort of closer to a functional test than a unit test.  Femtonit again, but I was thinking that it would be good to have a test specifically on the multiple-folder case, e.g., does this function return the right thing for foo/bar/baz/bink/qux/quxx?  (OK, it doesn\u0027t have to be *that* long, but at least a couple of elements :)",
