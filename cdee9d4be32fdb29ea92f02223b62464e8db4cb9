      "message": "Pinning to a specific version is probably not a good idea.  I realize that there are problems with 1.2.3 and that you\u0027re waiting for 1.2.4 (or perhaps 1.3.0?) to be released, but this could probably be written like so:\n\n    kerberos\u003e\u003d1.2.2,!\u003d1.2.3\n\nIf you want to set an upper bound to deal with backwards compatibility breaks before they happen, that could look like:\n\n    kerberos\u003e\u003d1.2.2,\u003c1.3,!\u003d1.2.3\n\nEven so, I would discourage placing an upper bound on this if it can be avoided…",

      "message": "What I like to do with unit tests is test each unit, that is, each function or method, independently.  That is, there\u0027d be a set of tests for __init__(), one for http_error_401(), etc.  I say \"set of tests\" because my personal preference is to try to test every single branch, and it\u0027s helpful to have each of those tests in a separate test method, so test failure messages can help you narrow down what failed.",
