This means that for Python 3, I would need 2 test-requirements.txt files - sigh.\n\nAn alternative is to use pytest which has its own assertRaises and then we wouldn\u0027t need unittest2/unittest2py3k - I love pytest, so this is probably my preferred route.\n\nOr monkeypatch in our own assertRaises (a la https://marmida.com/blog/index.php/2012/08/08/monkey-patching-assert_raises/), but that\u0027s kind of yucky.",
