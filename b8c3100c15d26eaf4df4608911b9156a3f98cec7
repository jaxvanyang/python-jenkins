      "message": "I\u0027m a little concerned that err_handle is somewhat misleading. What about a custom err_handler for other errors that occur, such as providing a callback to provide handling for other errors.\n\nI would suggest something that identifies this as response decoding at least.\n\nRather than trying to hack various options in to allow changing how we handle different error scenarios, perhaps a setting to control whether we return the raw response object instead of the response it self would be a solution here?",
