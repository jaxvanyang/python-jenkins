From reading the doc i would tend to think that it\u0027s just a list of job names, however it\u0027s actually a list of executables.  Specifying the return type and adding an example similar to get_info() would help.",

      "message": "Agreed, documentation is needed for the return type.  Also, I think it would be better if this gave you the names (and maybe build numbers) of the jobs; I can imagine that someone using this interface would want to use the return value to manually kill off some of the running builds.",
