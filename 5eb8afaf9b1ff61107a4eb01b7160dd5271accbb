      "message": "Though all parameters are significant, I never added them because they can be fetched for the individual node by get_node_info().\n\nI\u0027ve excluded some parameters from the node information, which were large, to reduce the time and payload when rest calls are made. For example, \"monitorData\" is a parameter containing much information.\n\nI\u0027ve included the parameters of utmost importance; if you think some other parameters are essential, please let me know, and I\u0027ll add them too. \n\nThe goal/ need of the function has been mentioned in the commit description.",
