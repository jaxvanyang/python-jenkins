      "message": "This summary doesn\u0027t seem to match what the change is actually doing, which is to allow jenkins_open() to pass back the raw response object, and using that support in the get_version() method.  I\u0027d like to see a more comprehensive description of what this change is doing and how it\u0027s accomplishing that task.  (I suspect that the trouble you\u0027re solving is that get_version()\u0027s direct use of urlopen() is not including certain headers that jenkins_open() is passing, so I\u0027m just looking for that to be spelled out explicitly in the commit message.)",
