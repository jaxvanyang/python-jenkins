I guess something changed in there and we have a patch to remove it entirely ( https://review.opendev.org/c/jjb/python-jenkins/+/877243 ).\n\nLooking at the openstack-tox-cover job, it comes with setuptools 67.4.0 while openstack-tox-py36 uses setuptools\u003d\u003d59.6.0. Locally I can reproduce the failure it comes from v66.0.0 https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/history.html#v66-0-0\n\n\u003e 15 Jan 2023\n\u003e Breaking Changes\n\u003e \n\u003e #2497: Support for PEP 440 non-conforming versions has been removed. Environments containing packages with non-conforming versions may fail or the packages may not be recognized.\n\n",
