I love six and usually I do use it my own projects.\n\nSometimes if a project doesn\u0027t have a lot of dependencies and/or doesn\u0027t need a lot of six stuff, I\u0027ll just include stuff inline, because folks will often balk at adding a dependency.\n\nBut since two people have mentioned six already, I\u0027ll probably use it.",
