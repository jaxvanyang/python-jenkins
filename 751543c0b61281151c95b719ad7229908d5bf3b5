But that\u0027s not actually correct because it will shutdown after all jobs complete correct?  I think these 2 options might be better:\n\n1.  Don\u0027t bother asserting that jenkins has shutdown.  Just tell user that \"Safe shutdown initiated, jenkins will shutdown once all jobs have completed\". \n\n2. If you prefer to assert that Jenkins has shutdown then I think we need to poll jenkins to make sure it\u0027s shutdown.  I think in this scenario i would just use the get_version() to check whether it\u0027s still up.",
