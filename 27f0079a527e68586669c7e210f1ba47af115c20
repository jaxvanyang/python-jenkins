      "message": "What I was trying to get at in my previous comment is that get_jobs() should just give me a list of jobs.  It shouldn\u0027t matter whether it\u0027s from folder or a view.  All variations seem to return the same dict of jobs.  Filtering by view/folder/none should be done with a parameter.  So if I want to get jobs on a specific view I should just pass in that view name.\n\n\n  get_jobs() - get all jobs on the server\n  get_jobs(my_folder) - get all jobs in my_folder\n  get_jobs(my_view) - get all jobs in my_view\n\n\nI think this is better than requiring the user to use multiple get_jobs methods.",
